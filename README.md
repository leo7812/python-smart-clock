To train the model used in this python smart application, I used a Kaggle dataset with 15 columns of different variables. However for my model I only applied four basic inputs that a user could input into the application; Age, Gender, Physical Activity (1-100), Stress Level(1-10).
Here is the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset
